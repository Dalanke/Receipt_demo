### Notesï¼š
* App created by `create-react-app`
* To open live application, it might take some time due to heroku limitation
* Items' name, price and images are taken from Amazon, for demo usage ONLY
* The data is hard-code, however, `getOrder...()` mimic the API call that return the data from back end
* For simplicity, date filters take some common filters (e.g. a week, a month, by year), it can easily extend to specified time range search
* For Safari, browser print window will close in 5s, because Safari choose no to block the code after `window.print()`, see implement in `OrderPrint` for detail
* This demo was created in hurry, might no meet best practice in some code, as well as no well documented. This demo is `Mobile-base`, might look awkward from desktop browser
